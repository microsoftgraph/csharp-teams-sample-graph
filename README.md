## Prerequisites

### O365 Account with Admin privileges

As the current Microsoft Teams Graph APIs are only accessible by a tenant admin, to run the app, you'll need to sign in with an account with admin privileges.  Note that in most companies, you might not have these rights, nor the ability to grant yourself these rights, therefore you might benefit from a developer account through our [Office 365 Developer program](https://dev.office.com/devprogram).  

### Registered app

You'll need to register an app through the following process:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
2. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the Azure AD tenant that you want.
3. Select **New registration**.
4. When the Register an application page appears, enter your application's registration information:
   * **Name** - Enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app.
   * **Supported account types** - Select which accounts you would like your application to support.
   * **Redirect URI (optional)** - Select **Web** and enter 'http://localhost:55065/' for the **Redirect URI**.
5. When finished, select **Register**.
6. Azure AD assigns a unique **application (client)** ID to your app, and you're taken to your application's **Overview** page. To add additional capabilities to your application, you can select other configuration options including branding, certificates and secrets, API permissions, and more. 

   - Copy the **Application Id.** This is the unique identifier for your app.
7. Under **Manage** on the left-hand pane, click **Certificates & secrets**.  Under **Client secrets**, click **New client secret**.  Enter a description and an expiration, then click **Add**.  This creates a secret string, or application password, which the application uses to prove it's identity.  

   Copy the value from the **new secret.**
8. Under **Manage** on the left-hand pane, click **Authentication**. Under **Implicit grant**, check **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**. During authentication, this enables the app to receive both sign-in info (the id_token) and artifacts (in this case, an authorization code) that the app can use to obtain an access token. Save your changes.
9. Under **Manage** on the left-hand pane, click **API permissions** and then **Add a new permission**. Select **Microsoft Graph** and then **Delegated permissions**. Add **'Group.ReadWrite.All' (Read and write all groups)** and **'User.ReadWrite.All' (Read and write all users' full profile)** permissions.

See the individual project readmes for more information.
    
### Build and run the sample app

1. Open the sample solution in **Visual Studio.**
2. Get your **app id** & **app secret** from the previous section
3. Create a file named **Web.config.secrets** (put it next to **Web.config**), and add in your appid and app secret:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <appSettings >
    <add key="ida:AppId" value="xxxxx"/>
    <add key="ida:AppSecret" value="xxxxx"/>
  </appSettings>
```

4. Update the **'Web Server'** of your web application with the **'ida:RedirectUri'** of your registered app 

* In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the name of the Web application project for which you want to specify a Web server, and then click **'Properties'**.
* In the **'Properties'** window, click the **'Web'** tab.
* Under **'Servers'**, update the **'Project Url'** with the **'ida:RedirectUri'** of your registered app.
* Click **'Create Virtual Directory'**
* Save the file.

5. Build and run the sample.

6. Sign in with your account, and grant the requested permissions.

* Note you'll need to have appropriate elevated rights to run the app **(Group.ReadWrite.All and User.ReadWrite.All)**

7. Choose operation, such as **'Get My Teams'**, **'Get Channels'**, **'Create Channel'** or **'Post Message'**.

8. Response information is displayed at the bottom of the page.
